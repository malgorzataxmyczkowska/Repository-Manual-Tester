Repository of Manual Tester - Małgorzata Myczkowska

Małgorzata Myczkowska - Junior Manual Tester in Progress, Teacher, Musician & Violinist.
I’ve graduated the Royal Conservatory in Brussels and the Academy of Music in Wrocław. 
I completed course: GET into QA from INCO Academy, and I have the necessary knowledge and experience about testing.
I really love software testing, despite that my education was in the field of performing music.
While the violin and IT industry sound totally different, but I see several common characteristics. 
In music field I’ve been always creative, striven for excellence, constantly improved the sound and intonation, bettered pieces, searched/heared incorrect notes and found solutions, like in testing. I’ve always test the piece before the production = the concert.
In my portfolio I would like to share my all gained experience from the scope of testing and show my skills.

Your welcome!
